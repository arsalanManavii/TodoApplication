# note_application
this is a basic note application that allows users create,update and delete their notes.
this app has a cronometer for users to start the timer(countDown) and do what they want to do in the specific amount of time.
notes are stored on device using Hive ,so the user can see the notes after closing the app(data persistence).

the main goal of creating this project was the ui design not create the whole funcionality,
but of course i will add some features to it later. so hope you guys like it and i will be useful to you.

# Goals of this project are :
1. create an app according to designer's ui design
2. working with complex ui such create custom widgets(timeline for tasks,circular countDown,
3. using custom paint to creates exact ui like designer's ui
4. learning Hive and implementing it with CRUD(create,read,update,delete) operaion
5. working with some new widgets like slidable
